## About AuroLeap

A fledgling organization with a passion for automation.

Currently, the project of focus is Gilbert, a full source-available robotic software deployment, such that it -as a software package- could be deployed to various robot frames which would operate as whole-house service robots.  Ideally to take on household or business chores, cleanup, event decoration, cooking, laundry, and the plethora of other daily tasks that consume our time and the time of those we love.
